# Fireworksgame
 
This is a simple fireworks game applet, implemented using Python and Pygame libraries. Players can bloom fireworks by clicking on the window with the mouse. The colors of the fireworks are random, and they gradually disappear after blooming, with an afterimage effect of the remaining props.

## Features

- Click the screen with the mouse to explode fireworks.
- Fireworks are randomly colored, gradually become smaller and disappear.
- As the frequency of clicks increases, the scope and complexity of the fireworks increases.
- Consumables will leave afterimages during movement, simulating fireworks recipes.
- You can exit the program by clicking the window's close button.

## Install

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the Pygame library:
   ````bash
   pip install pygame
